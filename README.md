# Context-Based Suggestion Search Engine
Suggestion of Context Sensitive Search Terms using Word and Sentence Embeddings

# Introdcution
Elasticsearch is now a very popular search engine based on Lucene. But we think, in future the simple keywords search is not enougy.
Therefore we consider to merge the machine learning technology, especially embeddings into traditional search engine. 
In order to improve the search performance, the following experiments will be tried.

# Implementation

1. Forked a basic elasticearch program, add another suggestion function into index.html

2. train model with tensorflow

3. load model from java program, and compare the original keywords search and suggestion search

# Word Embedding
